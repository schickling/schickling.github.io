title: Deployment with Capistrano 3
---

In November 2013 I published [an article on Nettuts+](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/php/deploying-a-laravel-application-using-capistrano) about deploying an application using Capistrano.

The original version of the article was all about Capistrano 2. I was using this system until now and was pretty happy with it. It did the job.

But due to several reader requests I updated the article to [Capistrano 3](http://capistranorb.com/2013/06/01/release-announcement.html) (it should be online soon!). I also upgraded all my apps using capistrano to the newest version. The upgrade process went frictionless and now the actual deployment runs even faster with Capistrano 3.

I'm very excited about all those new features and the configuration got much simpler than before. If you still do deployment "by hand" you should definitely check it out.
